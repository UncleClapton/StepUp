# Step Up Plus
Step Up Lets you walk up single blocks like they're half slabs.

## ⚠ Still in Testing ⚠

This mod is a fork of the original StepUp mod that has been available since 1.7.10.
We still ultimately use the same method to set the step height

## Differences from StepUp
- Simplified mode selection system. Vanilla auto-jump is no longer toggleable with hotkey.
- Removed per-server config setting. Opted for a default which is set when you join a world.
- Removed _all_ chat messages.
- Use built in forge update notification system.
- New HUD indicator which is fairly customizable
- New settings file which gives you control over:
    - Enable/Disable StepUp by default when joining worlds,
    - Fully adjustable step height (just be careful on servers!).
    - Customization of the HUD indicator
